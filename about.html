            <p>Everything started with my passion to Math. In 2014 I started Bachelor's degree in Mathematics in
                University of Wroc≈Çaw. At that time, I was not really thinking about being developer and I didn't know
                what I want to do in the future. </p>
            <p>On the second semester I started learning some basics of Object Oriented Programming in C++ and I really
                enjoyed it. After that, I started putting more effort and time in programming.</p>
            <p>June of 2017 was the key moment in my life. I graduated with Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and started
                Master's degree in the same area. Later, I got applied as Junior Developer in <a
                        href="http://blue-veery.com/" target="_blank">blue veery GmbH</a>.</p>
            <p>Right now I am on the second year of my Master's and working in <a href="http://blue-veery.com/" target="_blank">blue
                veery GmbH</a> on a variety of different
                projects.</p>
